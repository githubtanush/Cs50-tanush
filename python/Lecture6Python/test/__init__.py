'''With in my test directory i need to create a file called 
__init__.py which has the effect even if the file is empty 
of telling python that folder as not just a module but a 
package, so to speak A package is a python module or multiple
module is organized inside of a folder and this file __init__.py 
is just a visual indicator to python that indeed it should treat 
the folder as a package if i had more code in this folder i could 
do even more things with this file but for now it's just a clue to '
'that it's indeed meant to be a package and not just a module or
file alone what i can now do in closing is run pytest not even on 
that specific file, but on a whole folder of test'''
